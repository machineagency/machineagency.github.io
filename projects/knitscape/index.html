      <p class="abstract">
        Slipped and tucked stitches introduce small areas of deformation that compound and result in emergent textures on knitted fabrics.
        When used together with color changes and ladders, these can also produce dramatic colorwork and openwork effects.
        However, designing slip and tuck colorwork patterns is challenging due to the complex interactions between operations, yarns, and deformations.
        We present KnitScape, a browser-based tool for design and simulation of stitch patterns for knitting.
        KnitScape provides a design interface to specify 1) operation repeats, 2) color changes, and 3) needle positions.
        These inputs are used to build a graph of yarn topology and run a yarn-level spring simulation.
        This enables visualization of the deformation that arises from slip and tuck operations.
        Through its design tool and simulation, KnitScape enables rapid exploration of a complex colorwork design space.
        We demonstrate KnitScape with a series of example swatches.
