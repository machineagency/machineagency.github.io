    <p class="abstract">
      Digital fabrication software supports common activities like designing models and setting parameters. However, the
      increasing diversity of fabrication materials and contexts means that determining the right settings is a constant
      challenge. Manipulating machine parameters and observing material results is necessary for successful outcomes. In
      this work, we present tools to iteratively develop computer-controlled fabrication workflows. These tools generate
      toolpaths using Javascript code, continuously manipulate parameters during machine execution, and document the
      resulting material behavior. First, we present software to interactively tune 3D prints. We use a MIDI controller
      to modulate fabrication parameters during execution. We demonstrate our approach through a set of 3D prints
      created with our software. Second, we introduce software which synchronizes video of a fabrication process with
      the machine instructions being executed. Doing so archives the effect of manipulating machine parameters. We argue
      that infrastructure which encourages exploration and documentation of both code and materials are crucial to
      support broader uptake of fabrication technologies in creative contexts.
