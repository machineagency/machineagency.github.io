    <p class="abstract">
      The material properties of 3D prints depend on their constituent materials, how they were printed, and local
      geometrical features. Motivated by challenges in sharing physical details of 3D printing workflows including
      machine state and print settings, we contribute tools to support the exploration of the vast design space these
      interdependent parameters make up. Inspired by live music performance and video captioning, we contribute an
      interactive controller for parameters not represented in geometry such as speed and extrusion rate, and a system
      for automatically syncing video documentation to machine settings, G-Code, and print commands. By synchronizing
      video with machine instructions and interactive adjustments, we archive the relationship between digital settings
      and physical output for revisiting and sharing. We demonstrate example workflows in multiple materials. Our
      approach suggests how maker tools that promote settings exploration and sharing can support the integration of
      fabrication technologies in new contexts, with new materials.

  <p class="abstract">
    Digital fabrication software supports common activities like designing models and setting parameters
    However, the increasing diversity of fabrication materials and contexts means that determining the right settings is a constant challenge.
    Manipulating machine parameters and observing material results is necessary for successful outcomes. In this work, we present tools to iteratively develop computer-controlled fabrication workflows. These tools generate toolpaths using Javascript code, continuously manipulate parameters during machine execution, and document the resulting material behavior. First, we present software to interactively tune 3D prints. We use a MIDI controller to modulate fabrication parameters during execution. We demonstrate our approach through a set of 3D prints created with our software. Second, we introduce software which synchronizes video of a fabrication process with the machine instructions being executed. Doing so archives the effect of manipulating machine parameters. We argue that
    infrastructure which encourages exploration and documentation of both code and materials are crucial to support broader uptake of fabrication technologies in creative contexts.
