        In our design environment for editing knitting charts with blended
        primitives, a chart of knitting instructions is rasterized from layered
        vector boundaries and paths with associated raster stitch and yarn
        blocks. These cabled twist and braid patterns are designed using stitch
        paths we defined to encode a “right-leaning twist” (A) and a
        “left-leaning twist” (B). By placing the right twist along a stitch path
        that defines a purl border (C), we can produce a twist texture (D). By
        staggering both the left and right twists (E), we can produce a braid
        texture (F)

      <p class="abstract">
        In chart-based programming environments for machine knitting, patterns
        are specified at a low level by placing operations on a grid. This
        highly manual workflow makes it challenging to iterate on design
        elements such as cables, colorwork, and texture. While vector-based
        abstractions for knitting design elements may facili- tate higher-level
        manipulation, they often include interdependen- cies which require
        stitch-level reconciliation. To address this, we contribute a new way of
        specifying knits with blended vector and raster primitives. Our
        abstraction supports the design of interdepen- dent elements like
        colorwork and texture. We have implemented our blended raster/vector
        specification in a direct manipulation design tool where primitives are
        layered and rasterized, allowing for simulation of the resulting knit
        structure and generation of ma- chine instructions. Through examples, we
        show how our approach enables higher-level manipulation of various
        knitting techniques, including intarsia colorwork, short rows, and
        cables. Specifically, we show how our tool supports the design of
        complex patterns including origami pleat patterns and capacitive sensor
        patches.
