          New digital fabrication workflows require both software development
          and digital/physical material exploration. To support digital
          fabrication workflow development, we contribute infrastructure that
          prioritizes extensibility and iteration. Dynamic Toolchains are
          dataflow programs with event-driven feedback between interactive,
          stateful modules. We contribute a browser-based dataflow environment
          for running Dynamic Toolchains, a library of fabrication-oriented
          front- and back-end modules for design and machine control, and a
          development framework for building custom modules. Furthermore, we
          show how our infrastructure supports unconventional fabrication
          workflows with demonstrations that include interactive watercolor
          painting, map plotting, machine knitting, audio embroidery, textured
          3d printing, and computer-controlled milling. These demonstrations
          show how our infrastructure supports multiple kinds of engagement
          including reuse, remix, and extension. Finally, we discuss how this
          work contributes to broader conversations in HCI on creativity across
          the digital/physical divide.
