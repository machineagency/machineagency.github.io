      <p class="abstract">
        As digital fabrication machines become widespread, online communities
        have provided space for diverse practitioners to share their work,
        troubleshoot, and socialize. These communities pioneer increasingly
        novel fabrication workflows, and it is critical that we understand and
        conceptualize these workflows beyond traditional manufacturing models.
        To this end, we conduct a qualitative study of #PlotterTwitter, an
        online community developing custom hardware and software tools to create
        artwork with computer-controlled drawing machines known as plotters. We
        documented and analyzed emergent themes where the traditional
        interpretation of digital fabrication workflows fails to capture
        important nuances and nascent directions. We find that #PlotterTwitter
        makers champion creative exploration of interwoven digital and physical
        materials over a predictable series of steps. We discuss how this
        challenges long-running views of digital fabrication and propose design
        implications for future frameworks and toolkits to account for this
        breadth of practice.
